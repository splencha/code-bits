As the description says, this is just a collection of useful, interesting, or otherwise important-to-me bits of stuff. Could be any language or set of data. My interests vary form coding in several languages, to biological research in taxonomy, evolution, and environmental physiology, particularly of terrestrial arthropods, to the theoretical underpinnings of certain mathematical objects, to the fractal nature of music (and other natural phenomena), to poetry, to, well, whatever I happen to be working on.
